Hi, my name is Ashlyn and I am passionate about creating software that helps ease the burden of business and life in general. I believe that technology is something that can enhance anyoneâ€™s life and business, and have seen that in my own life. I formerly worked as an Accounts Executive for a coffee company and utilized different tech applications to streamline operations at the company, making it more efficient and increasing profits. I decided that I wanted to be the one to create those technologies that I was using, so I began my journey into the tech industry. I really value helping others, organization, efficiency and creativity and the fact that I can combine all of that into a career that helps other people is really exciting to me.
